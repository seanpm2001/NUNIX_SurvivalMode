# NUNIX SurvivalMode

`🧠️🦁️ The survival mode component of NUNIX, a set of operating instruction supplements for survival.`

> _Part of the [:octocat: `NUNIX operating system project`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/NUNIX/)_

## Summary

SurvivalMode is a set of components within the NUNIX operating system that offers added methods for organism survival, and fallback for when previous methods have failed (such as braindeath)

A lion was chosen as the logo, due to its notability in survival in nature, and how the ecosystem works around/with it. This can apply to most animals, but it is one of the most common examples.

## Debate

It is currently being debated whether NUNIX should have this much power in controlling the mind, and how this can work as a fallback. This feature, and its components may be abandoned/reworked if it is determined to pose an existential risk.
